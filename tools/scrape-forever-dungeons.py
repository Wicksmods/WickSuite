"""Collect the loot tables of Forever's levelling dungeons from Wowhead.

Wowhead's Forever database carries real stats and real drop sources, and a
dungeon's zone page embeds its drop list as JSON inside a Listview. That
is far kinder than scraping rendered pages: one request per dungeon, no
browser, and the fields come out typed.

    python WickSuite/tools/scrape-forever-dungeons.py
    python WickSuite/tools/scrape-forever-dungeons.py --one 1581

Writes WickSuite/data/forever/dungeon-loot.json.

Stat values are not in the listview, only on each item's own tooltip, so
this collects the roster: what drops, from whom, at what item level and
for which slot. Stats are a second pass, deliberately separate so this
one stays a single cheap request per dungeon.

# wowhead.com/forever/zones/instances. That page is rendered by script so
# it cannot be fetched here; it was read once in a browser and the ids
# written down. Re-read it when the beta adds dungeons, which it does:
# this list was hand-written from Classic knowledge to begin with and was
# missing Ruins of Lordaeron, the Hall of Thanes, Karazhan Crypts, and
# all four of Dire Maul, Stratholme, Scholomance and Blackrock Depths.
#
# Level ranges are Forever's own, not Classic's; several have been
# retuned. None means Wowhead does not give one yet, and a range is
# worked out from what the loot requires instead.
#
# Zones with nothing in them are kept on purpose. Wowhead's Forever data
# is crowdsourced, so an empty dungeon today is a filled one later, and
# the emitter drops anything still empty.
