"""Collect Forever's item sets from Wowhead.

One page carries the lot. wowhead.com/forever/item-sets writes the whole
catalogue into a plain `itemSets = [...]` variable before it builds the
Listview, so unlike the dungeon pages there is nothing to page through
and no per-set request to make: one fetch, 500-odd sets, 3000-odd pieces.

    python WickSuite/tools/scrape-forever-sets.py

Writes WickSuite/data/forever/item-sets.json, holding both the sets and a
flat item id to set name index, which is what the emitter actually wants:
the question at emit time is always "what set is this item in", never
"what is in this set".

Sets whose pieces are not in the gear data are kept anyway. They cost a
few bytes and the gear data grows as the beta fills in.
