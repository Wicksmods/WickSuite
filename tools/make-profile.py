"""Bake the suite's current settings into an addon that loads them back.

On the Forever beta the client writes every addon's saved variables at
logout and hands back nothing at load. Addon files themselves load fine,
though, so this reads what the game wrote to WTF and generates
!WicksProfile, which puts those tables back before anything else starts.

Run it after logging out, from anywhere:

    python WickSuite/tools/make-profile.py
    python WickSuite/tools/make-profile.py --list     # what it would take

Log out first, or you will bake whatever was on disk before this session.
