"""Carry macros from one WoW install to another.

Written for Anniversary to the Forever beta, and kept because the same
move has to happen again at launch.

Macros live in macros-cache.txt, one file for the account and one per
character. The format is a header line, the body, and END:

    VER 3 0000000000000001 "water" "132793"
    #showtooltip
    /cast Conjure Water
    END

The id's top byte is the scope: 00 is an account macro, 01 is a
character one. The rest is a sequence within that scope, so anything
merged in has to be renumbered or the client drops the collision.

    python WickSuite/tools/import-macros.py            # say what it would do
    python WickSuite/tools/import-macros.py --apply    # do it

Nothing is written while the game is running: the client rewrites its
own WTF on the way out and would throw the import away.
